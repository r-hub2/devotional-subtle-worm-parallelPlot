# parallelPlot 0.4.0

  * new API for `refColumnDim` to specify the column used to determine the color used for each row
  * fire an event when `refColumnDim` is changed
  * new API for `highlightRow` to specify the highlighted row
  * fire an event when a row is highlighted

* Changed:
  * *breaking change*, if `eventInputId` argument is `NULL`, it means no event is sent (before, it meant a default value was used)
  * *breaking change*, `cutoff` event has a new attribute `adjusting`, `TRUE` when pointer is moving, changing a cutoff (before, the `cutoff` event was only sent once the mouse gesture had been completed)
  * javascript version of the graph is now available in three formats: [iife](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-iife), [CommonJS](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-commonjs) and [ECMAScript module](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-esm)
  * the default background color is changed from grey to white
  * sliders are more attractive (use a frame rather than a central axis; use rounded edges)
