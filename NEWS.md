* Changed:
  * *breaking change*, if `eventInputId` argument is `NULL`, it means no event is sent (before, it meant a default value was used)
  * *breaking change*, `cutoff` event has a new attribute `adjusting`, `TRUE` when pointer is moving, changing a cutoff (before, the `cutoff` event was only sent once the mouse gesture had been completed)
